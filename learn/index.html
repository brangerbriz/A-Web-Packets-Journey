                    The Internet is the greatest technical human achievement of our era! But the <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/" target="_blank">Internet's health</a> is waning, and restoring it to its fullest potential requires an informed netizenry. No single person or organization controls the Internet or the Web. It belongs to those who choose to get involved. We're hoping this <a href="../play">game</a>, as well as the supplementary materials below, help expand your appreciation for our shared technical masterpiece and perhaps inspire you to take an active role in caring for the Web!
                </p>

                <h2>the Journey</h2>

                            When you "visit" a website, your computer (game console, laptop, smart phone, etc) is actually sending a request (a tiny file) across the planet! Initially that process happens over the air until it reaches the antenna of your router or cell tower. From there, cables connect computers all around the world together. Some of these cables lie underneath our streets while others span the ocean floors. Beaming across these cables at light speed, that request packet eventually reaches a server on another computer, before returning all the way back to your computer with the website (which itself is just another tiny file). In A Web Packet's Journey, you play as a packet as it traverses the globe through the radio waves, cables and computers that make up the Internet.
